*** summary
pix is a minimalist gallery system.  less than 300 lines of code allow you to
organize all your photos, we traverse a directory structure and as-needed
generate thumb-nails and web optimized versions of your images.  thru a simple
'.meta' file in each directory you can assign descriptions to each image.

pix doesn't try to do what other programs do well.  in true unix style pix
does one thing and does it well in a very transparent manner. 
- no image cropping or rotating; irfanview, gimp, etc.. all do a better job and 
  are more flexible.
- no album management; the filesystem is a familiar and intuitive way 
  to manage your images.
- no uploads; if you have an account on a box and are running cgi/ php scripts,
  you should have a firm grasp on ftp or scp.


*** install instructions
- make sure python image library is installed
  on debian you can do: apt-get install python-imaging
  or find PIL and extract it in the same directory as pix
- create a directory pix/album
- chmod -R 777 pix/album


*** album setup and guidelines
- your directory structure will dictate the hierarhcy for albums and picture
  placement
- use underscores in album names and picture names
  for example: 'new_years_eve_2004'
  or: 'demian_posing_with_elvis.jpg'
- in each directory optionally create a .meta file, the format is
  <pic file name> = <description>
  it's not necessary to have every file in there.  in vim do: ':r!ls' to get a
  complete listing of the files in this directory.
  the description can only be on 1 line!


*** trouble shooting
- are there files in the album directory that are not images?
- is the permission of the album directory 777?


*** todo:
- need to have better error/ exception handling
  absolutely no more white screens or server errors
- resize based on height as well as width
- write a means for clearing image caches from the web so all the 'nobody' files
  will go away.
