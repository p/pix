*** summary
pix is a minimalist gallery system.  less than 300 lines of code allow you to
organize all your photos, we traverse a directory structure and as-needed
generate thumb-nails and web optimized versions of your images.  thru a simple
'.meta' file in each directory you can assign descriptions to each image.

pix doesn't try to do what other programs do well.  in true unix style pix
does one thing and does it well in a very transparent manner. 
- no image cropping or rotating; irfanview, gimp, etc.. all do a better job and 
  are more flexible.
- no album management; the filesystem is a familiar and intuitive way 
  to manage your images.
- no uploads; if you have an account on a box and are running cgi/ php scripts,
  you should have a firm grasp on ftp or scp.


*** install instructions
- make sure python image library is installed
  on debian you can do: apt-get install python-imaging
  or find PIL and extract it in the same directory as pix
- create a directory pix/album
- chmod -R 777 pix/album


*** album setup and guidelines
- your directory structure will dictate the hierarhcy for albums and picture
  placement
- use underscores in album names and picture names
  for example: 'new_years_eve_2004'
  or: 'demian_posing_with_elvis.jpg'
- .meta file guide 
  - in each directory optionally create a .meta file, the format is
    <pic file name> = <description>
  - it's not necessary to have every file in there.  in vim do: ':r!ls' to get a
    complete listing of the files in this directory.  then just slap a 
    '= <description>' on each line you want ot provide a description.
  - the description can only be on 1 line!
  - the only lines that can have an '=' are description lines, don't put them
    into the description
  - to add a description for the current album create 2 lines at the top,
    literally <album description> and </album description>.  between these
    lines put the description.  don't use the '=' character because i use
    that as the token to fine picture description lines.

- template guide
  the template file is just a simple html document you can pretty much do with
  it what you want, you place the tokens for the generated elements into your 
  html.
  - @title@
    shows you the current directory with a pipe in front of it (the assumption
    is that you will have a string before the pipe, like the name of your site
  - @breadcrumb@
    a pipe "|" delimited string that shows you where you are at in the directory
    hierarchy inside the albums.  it gives you links to go to what ever level
    you want
  - @albums@
    if there are no sub-directories in the current directory this returns an
    empty string.
    if there are sub-directories this gives you the string '<h2>albums</h1>'
    followed by an unordered list of albums.
  - @pics@
    this returns thumbnail images of all the pictures in the current directory.
    the thumbnails dictate what the web sized pic will be
  - @album-description@
    if there is no currently selected web-pic we print the album description, 
    this is found in the '.meta' file.  all lines between the "album
    description" tags will be displayed as the album description.
  - @web-pic@
    when the user selects a thumbnail or picture from the list, the web pic is
    displayed.  the web pic is resized for typical web viewing.  if the user
    wants to see the original image (assuming it's larger than the web-pic)
    they can click on the web version to be directed to the actual original.
  - @comment@
    this is where the comment (if any) associated with the picture is placed.


*** administration
- to delete the cache recursively from your current album append this
  to the url '&admin=clean'.  for example:
  http://localhost/~demian/pix/?album=/demian&admin=clean
  this deletes every thumbnail and web-image recursively from the 
  demian album on down.


*** trouble shooting
- are there files in the album directory that are not images?
- is the permission of the album directory 777?
- if [Errno 13] Permission denied
  pix (running under the web-server) needs to be able to write to all the 
  directories so that it can create thumbnails.  you can "chmod -R 777 ./album".


*** change log
- 1.2.0 from 1.1.3
stole lots of great stuff form the quickypix project (http://quarl.org)
  - minor defect fixes
  - 'alt' text for thumbnail images so when users mouse-over they
    can see the name of the picture.  
  - 'alt' text for the web image to hint users to the fact that they
    can click on it to see the original image.
  - an all-encompassing except so that you never get a white screen
    and the user can see the raised exception.
  - the selected thumbnail will have a style sheet id so that it's 
    presentation can be altered, in my style sheet i change the border
    color to red instead of black.
  - add an admin function to clean by appending &admin=clean to the url
  - removed the 'list' form of displaying the pictures, the thumbnails
    are much more useful and it simplifies the code
  - display the numbers of sub-albums and pictures in the current album
