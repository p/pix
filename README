*** summary
pix is a minimalist gallery system.  less than 400 lines of code allow you to
organize all your photos, we traverse a directory structure and as-needed
generate thumb-nails and web optimized versions of your images.  thru a simple
'.meta' file in each directory you can assign comments to each image.

pix doesn't try to do what other programs do well.  in true unix style pix
does one thing and does it well in a very transparent manner. 
- no image cropping or rotating; irfanview, gimp, etc.. all do a better job and 
  are more flexible.
- no album management; the filesystem is a familiar and intuitive way 
  to manage your images.
- no uploads; if you have an account on a box and are running cgi/ php scripts,
  you should have a firm grasp on ftp or scp.


*** install instructions
- make sure python image library is installed
  on debian you can do: apt-get install python-imaging
  or find PIL and extract it in the same directory as pix
- create a directory pix/album
- chmod -R 777 pix/album


*** album setup and guidelines
- your directory structure will dictate the hierarhcy for albums and picture
  placement
- use underscores in album names and picture names
  for example: 'new_years_eve_2004'
  or: 'demian_posing_with_elvis.jpg'


*** anatomy of a .meta file
  - in each directory optionally create a .meta file, the format for the 
    picture comments are
    <pic file name> = <comment>
  - it's not necessary to have every file in there.  in vim do: ':r!ls' to get a
    complete listing of the files in this directory.  then just slap a 
    '= <comment>' on each line you want to provide a comment.
  - the comment for a picture can only be on 1 line!
  - to add a description for the current album create 2 lines at the top,
    literally <album description> and </album description>.  between these
    lines put the description.
  - to control the thumbnail order, add a '=' after the file name wether or
    not the picture has a comment associated with it and put them in the
    order you want in the .meta file.
    pictures with no '=' and pictures not in the .meta file will be put at
    the end of the thumbnails in no particular order.
  - here is a sample .meta file (in between the snip tags!)
    so in the example below demian_and_leo.jpg would go first, then 
    dawn_demian_bobbi.jpg and lastly mom.jpg.  mom.jpg would go last since
    it has no '='
<snip>
<album description>
here are some pictures of my family.  these
were taken at family reunions and stuff.
</album description>
demian_and_leo.jpg = this is me and my cousin leo
mom.jpg
dawn_demian_bobbi.jpg =
</snip>


*** style sheets
- some extra style sheets are in pix/extra_styles.  the easiest way to use them
  is to just "cp pix/extra_styles/red_pill.css pix/style.css".

*** anatomy of the template file
the template file is 'pix/template.html' it's just a simple html document,  
you can pretty much do with it what you want, you place the tokens for the 
generated elements into your html.
- @title@
 shows you the current directory with a pipe in front of it (the assumption
 is that you will have a string before the pipe, like the name of your site
- @breadcrumb@
 a pipe "|" delimited string that shows you where you are at in the directory
 hierarchy inside the albums.  it gives you links to go to what ever level
 you want
- @albums@
 if there are no sub-directories in the current directory this returns an
 empty string.
 if there are sub-directories this gives you the string '<h2>albums</h1>'
 followed by an unordered list of albums.
- @pics@
 this returns thumbnail images of all the pictures in the current directory.
 the thumbnails dictate what the web sized pic will be
- @album-description@
 if there is no currently selected web-pic we print the album description, 
 this is found in the '.meta' file.  all lines between the "album
 description" tags will be displayed as the album description.
- @web-pic@
 when the user selects a thumbnail or picture from the list, the web pic is
 displayed.  the web pic is resized for typical web viewing.  if the user
 wants to see the original image (assuming it's larger than the web-pic)
 they can click on the web version to be directed to the actual original.
- @comment@
 this is where the comment (if any) associated with the picture is placed.


*** administration
- to delete the cache recursively from your current album append this
  to the url '&admin=clean'.  for example:
  http://localhost/~demian/pix/?album=/demian&admin=clean
  this deletes every thumbnail and web-image recursively from the 
  demian album on down.


*** trouble shooting
- are there files in the album directory that are not images?
- is the permission of the album directory 777?
- if [Errno 13] Permission denied
  pix (running under the web-server) needs to be able to write to all the 
  directories so that it can create thumbnails.  you can "chmod -R 777 ./album".


*** change log
- 1.2.1 from 1.2.0
  - improved the processing performance, i was doing a ton of 
    un-necessary processing for each line wether or not it was needed.
  - pictures can now be ordered in the .meta file.  pictures with no '=' 
    after them or pictures not included in the .meta file will be 
    forgivingly dumped at the end of the sorted thumbnails.

- 1.2.0 from 1.1.3
stole lots of great stuff form the quickypix project (http://quarl.org)
  - minor defect fixes
  - 'alt' text for thumbnail images so when users mouse-over they
    can see the name of the picture.  
  - 'alt' text for the web image to hint users to the fact that they
    can click on it to see the original image.
  - an all-encompassing except so that you never get a white screen
    and the user can see the raised exception.
  - the selected thumbnail will have a style sheet id so that it's 
    presentation can be altered, in my style sheet i change the border
    color to red instead of black.
  - add an admin function to clean by appending &admin=clean to the url
  - removed the 'list' form of displaying the pictures, the thumbnails
    are much more useful and it simplifies the code
  - display the numbers of sub-albums and pictures in the current album
  - included a handful of optional style sheets that are easy to use
