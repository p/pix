		<h2>navigation</h2>
		navigation is pretty intuitive, in fact it has passed the 
		<i>mom test</i>.  here are the concepts that you need to be concerned
		with for navigating the pix web application.

		<h3>bread crumb</h3>
		the bread crumb is the pipe "|" separated list that shows you the
		hierarchy of where you are at in the structure of photo albums.  at
		any time you can go up to albums you have previously viewed.
		<h3>albums</h3>
		the albums are actually sub-albums of the current album you are in, 
		click on those links to drill down into the hierarchy, you can return
		to where you came from by using the bread crumbs.
		<h2>pictures</h2>
		for any given image there can be 3 different sizes that pix will show you.
		<h3>thumbnail</h3>
		pix shows you thumbnails or a list of all the pictures in the current 
		album.  thumbnails are very small, quick to load, easy to fit on a page
		and supposed to give you an idea of what the picture is.  

		<h3>web friendly</h3>
		web friendly pictures are of a good dimension for displaying on the web
		under most conditions, reasonably quick to load but still big enough to 
		see the details of the picture.

		you can see the web friendly pics by clicking on the thumbnails or the
		picture name in a picture list.

		<h3>original</h3>
		the original might be huge.  this is the original picture that pix used
		to create the thumbs and web-friendly images.

		when you see the web friendly version of a picture you can click on that
		to get the original picture.  sometimes the original picture takes a long
		time to download.
	
		the pix administrator does have the ability to turn off access to the 
		original.  this can be done to limit bandwidth usage.
